TCP: Transmission Control Protocol (TCP) is a connection-oriented protocol that ensures reliable data transfer between devices over a network.

UDP: User Datagram Protocol (UDP) is a connectionless protocol that allows fast, but less reliable, data transfer without error-checking.

tcp.port==443 or 80: This filter captures TCP traffic on ports 443 (HTTPS) or 80 (HTTP), commonly used for web communication.

udp.port==443 or 80: This filter captures UDP traffic on ports 443 or 80, which could be used in applications needing quick data transfer over these ports.

ip.addr==192.168.3.39: This filter captures all network traffic to or from the IP address 192.168.3.39.

DNS: Domain Name System (DNS) translates human-readable domain names into IP addresses for locating web resources.

ARP: Address Resolution Protocol (ARP) resolves IP addresses to MAC addresses, allowing devices to communicate on a local network.

Promiscuous Mode: Promiscuous mode allows a network interface to capture all packets on the network, not just those addressed to it.
